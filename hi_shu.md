Hope you are finding the course okay

Hello Harry - I am relevant experienced with Python, but still find it quite dense (not a bad thing), how do you find it so far?

I understand it must be difficult for them to teach this content for ~70 people but I wish they didn't keep overrunning every day. Looking forward to getting into the more advanced Python stuff as the past few days have mostly been going over stuff I have already done. Its a nice change from my normal work however so I can't complain.
